<p>We're always hearing from our listeners about how much you love VPR and why you choose to support us. In fact, we've heard you make the case far better than we ever could! So, for our upcoming campaign, we're turning the tables and asking you to record your best pitch for supporting VPR. We might use your pitch on the radio or online to help encourage others to give during our campaign to eliminate the June drive. You can also record your pitch on your smartphone and send an MP3 to community@vpr.net. Thanks!</p>
